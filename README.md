# Card me

Create personal cards for your profile

### What is this for?

This is used to create little card with your profile information. It can be used as an interactive way to people use your pre-made CLI and check out your social media, etc.

This is a preview of a normal card.

```
   ┌─────────── Mauro's card ────────────┐
   │                                     │
   │       Work : Open source projects   │
   │     GitHub : mauro-balades          │
   │    Twitter : @Maubg7                │
   │                                     │
   └─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The following list will contain the optional values you can have in your card.

* Work

* Dev.to
* LinkedIn
* Twitter

and more to soon.

*NOTE*: you can always edit your card in `[name]-card/index.js`
